## DESCRIPTION
 
As a project manager, I want to be able to assign simple tasks that are time sensitive to my team. This project was built in order to have an alternative to complicated task managers. This will solve the issues that arise from not organizing your tasks in small or large groups. 

The login screen will bring up our logo and an option to login or create a new account. Once logged in, you will be directed to your account's home screen, where you will see project cards, with summarized information, assigned to your account team, or if you have just created your login you will see a sample tasks for the user to start getting to know the features of the app. Once you click on a project card you will be redirected to the full information on the card, with options to add a new card, edit or delete the existing card.
